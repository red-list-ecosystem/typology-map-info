This is an information site for users of the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology (IUCN GET). 

You can explore the ecosystems of the world in our webapp [//global-ecosystems.org](https://global-ecosystems.org).

In this site we share information about how we build the maps, some important technical details, and tips about how to use them in (y)our favourite GIS apps.
