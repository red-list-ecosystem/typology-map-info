This archive contains information for *F1.1 Permanent upland streams*, a ecosystem functional group (EFG, level 3) of the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology (https://global-ecosystems.org/).

General notes on maps:
======================

The maps show areas of the world containing major or minor occurrences of *F1.1 Permanent upland streams*. Minor occurrences are areas where an EFG is scattered in patches within matrices of others or where they occur in substantial areas but only within a segment of a larger region.

The maps were designed to be indicative of global distribution patterns and are not intended to represent fine-scale patterns. Given bounds of resolution and accuracy of source data, the maps should be used to query which EFG are likely to occur within areas, rather than which occur at particular point locations.

Methods for this map:
=====================

Freshwater ecoregions  (Abell et al. 2008) were initially identified as containing permanent upland streams if: i) their descriptions mentioned features consistent with those identifed in the profile of the Ecosystem Functional Group; and ii) if their location was consistent with the ecological drivers described in the profile. The selected ecoregions were then clipped to exlude cold or dry climates (mean temperature of coldest quarter >0°C, mean annual preipitation >300mm) based on data from Karger et al. (2017). Major occurrences were mapped by intersecting the selected ecoregions with the distribution of 1st-3rd order streams taken from the RiverATLAS (v1.0) database at 30 arc seconds spatial resolution (Linke et al. 2019). The remaining areas within selected ecoregions (excluding freeze/thaw areas) were designated as minor occurrences.
