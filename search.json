    "text": "The typology has been through an extensive development and review process initiated and co-ordinated by the IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management. The initial structure of the typology was developed at a forum attended by 48 specialists in marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems at Kings College London in May 2017. Lead contributors then drafted descriptive profiles for each Ecosystem Functional Group in consultation with other experts. Review of the definition and arrangement of units within the typological hierarchy was co-ordinated by the lead author (D. Keith) through the IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management.\nThis consultation and review process was an extensive community effort, with “ecosystem leaders” engaged for all major biomes and realms in the world representing the collective views of global research networks numbering hundreds of people. In all, some 30 specialists formally reviewed 1-14 profiles each, with less formal comment and input received through a much larger number of experts at international conferences, workshops and meetings during 2017-2019. As part of a broader consultation process, workshops arranged by IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management and international conference symposia, each attended by 20-100 participants were held at the following locations and dates:\n\nLondon, UK May 2017– IUCN workshop/meeting\nCartagena, Colombia July 2017 – IUCN workshop/meeting\nCartagena, Colombia July 2017 – ICCB symposium\nNaypyidaw, Myanmar, Sept 2017 – IUCN workshop/meeting\nNewcastle, Australia, November 2017 – ESA symposium\nCanberra, Australia, May 2018 – Boden conference\nDavos Switzerland, June 2018 – Polar2018 symposium\nGland Switzerland June 2018 – IUCN workshop/meeting\nAmman, Jordan, Sept 2018 – IUCN workshop/meeting\nDubai, UAE, Oct 2018 – Eye ON Earth symposium\nKuala Lumpur, Malaysia July 2019 – ICCB symposium\nMaputo, Mozambique, Mar 2019 – IUCN workshop/meeting\nMombasa, Kenya Mar 2019 – IUCN workshop/meeting\nNew York, USA, June 2019 – UN SEEA-EEA forum of experts\nJurmala, Latvia, Sept 2019 – IUCN workshop/meeting\nHelsinki, Finland, Oct 2019 – IUCN workshop/meeting\nSydney, Australia, Nov 2019 – Ocean Ecosystems Accounting symposium\n\nThe process outlined above involved up to five iterations of review and revision for each descriptive profile, and sometimes involved significant addition of content, revision of group definitions or recognition of additional groups. All profiles were reviewed and edited for conceptual consistency by D. Keith, and subject to a final production edit."

This DOI (digital object identifier) automatically resolves to the latest version, but we need to be explicit when we use the parallel download (otherwise it could get stuck in the first DOI):\n\ndoi = \"10.5281/zenodo.3546513\"\nZR &lt;- get_zenodo(doi=doi)\n(newest_doi &lt;- ZR$getLastDOI())\n\n[1] \"10.5281/zenodo.10081251\"\n\n\nWe will create a folder for this direct download from zenodo for the latest version of the bundle:\n\nout_folder &lt;- here::here(\"gisdata\", \"indicative-maps-bundle\",\"latest\")\nif (!dir.exists(out_folder))\n    dir.create(out_folder, recursive = TRUE)\n\nThis can be used to download directly to the output folder.

    "text": "Full profile at https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/T5.4\n\n\nCool deserts and semi-deserts occur on cool temperate plains and plateaus in central Eurasia and temperate parts of the Americas from sea level up to 4,000 m. Strong winds and freezing temperatures prevail, with low annual precipitation falling as winter snow or sleet. Productivity is low on infertile sandy and clay soils, often with high salinity.

Some organisms appear to be exclusive to sea caves, some shelter in sea caves diurnally, and others are itinerant visitors.\n\n\n\nWave-exposed caves provide dim light and shelter to cave-exclusive, resident and transient/ migratory invertebrates and fish..\n\n\n\nCoastal headlands, rocky and coral reefs globally."

Photosynthesis in these ecosystems accounts for half of all global carbon fixation. That productivity supports diverse marine life, including many visual predators, like tuna, that rely on the high light environment. Migration is a common life history trait across all groups: either vertical – rising from the depths to feed at the surface at night to evade daytime predators; or horizontal – between breeding and feeding grounds. Detritus from this zone is an important nutrient source for lower oceanic layers.\n\n\n\nUppermost euphotic ocean, where phytoplankton production supports abundant mobile zooplankton, fish, cephalopods, mammals and seabirds.\n\n\n\nSurface layer of the open ocean."

Some groups of plants, birds, reptiles, and invertebrates have high diversity and uniqueness, many with locally restricted distributions. Plants and animals are adapted for persistence through successive summer droughts and fires and, although sensitive to fire frequency and season, periodic disturbance by fire is critical to maintaining forest diversity.\n\n\n\nSclerophyll forests and woodlands in warm climates with winter precipitation and a canopy-fire regime.\n\n\n\nTemperate regions of Australia, the Mediterranean, and California."

Autotrophs are primary producers in trophic webs.\nBiogenic: A structure created by living organisms, e.g. a coral reef, tunnels in soils or sediment\nC3: The most common photosynthetic pathway in plants based only on the Calvin cycle with associated energy loss to photorespiration and dependence on daytime CO2 uptake, dominating environments with abundant moisture, and cool temperatures.\nC4: A photosynthetic pathway with a supplementary C-fixation pathway that minimises photorespiration, reduces CO2 demand and increases water use efficiency, often dominating warm and dry environments.\nCAM: A specialised C4 photosynthetic pathway in which CO2 uptake and fixation occurs during the night, followed by internal release in daytime when light dependent photosynthesis can take place. Stomatal closure during the day, reducing moisture loss enabling survival in very hot, dry conditions.\nChemoautotroph: An organism that fixes carbon from its surroundings using energy from inorganic chemical reactions.\nC:N ratio: Carbon to nitrogen ratio in biological tissues. Reflects differences in tissue composition related to nitrogen availability and capture, as well as woodiness in plants.\nEuphotic: A zone with abundant light, and hence able to support photosynthesis.\nHeterotroph: An organism that cannot manufacture its own food by carbon fixation and therefore derives its intake of nutrition from other sources of organic carbon, mainly plant or animal matter. In the food chain, heterotrophs are secondary and tertiary consumers. Heterotrophs are consumers in trophic webs, including decomposers, detritivores, herbivores and predators.\nLAI: Leaf Area Index, the projected area of leaves as a proportion of the area of land in which it is measured. Useful in remote sensing for describing vegetation density.\nMesophotic: A zone of oderate light intensity, able to support photosynthesis.\nPhotoautotroph: An organism that fixes carbon from its surroundings using energy from light\nPrimary productivity: The amount of chemical energy, expressed as carbon biomass that autotrophs create in a given length of time.\nSecondary productivity: Biomass of heterotrophic (consumer) organisms generated in a given length of time, driven by the transfer of organic material between trophic levels\nSemelparous: Plant life cycle with a single reproductive episode before death.\nSLA: Specific Leaf Area, the ratio of area of a fresh leaf to its dry mass. Positively related to plant relative growth rate."

This is crucial, as important conservation action occurs at local levels, where most expertise resides.\n\n\nThe typology is based on an explicit theoretical framework with contributions from an extensive global network of ecosystem experts. It differs from the IUCN Habitats Classification Scheme, designed to characterize habitats of individual species rather than ecosystem processes. Version 2.1 includes a set of systematic profiles describing the key ecological traits, functional processes and global distribution of biomes and ecosystem functional groups throughout the biosphere. The typology applies the same classificatory framework and underlying model to ecosystems across marine, freshwater, terrestrial and subterranean environments.\n\n\nVersion 2.0 was published as an IUCN Report . The new version contains updated nomenclature, two additional units and many updates in content and maps.\n\n\n\nThe conservation and management of ecosystems has never been more central to the future of biodiversity and human well-being on Earth. The CBD Aichi targets and UN Sustainable Development Goals mandate global action that depends directly or indirectly on ecosystem assessment.

All initiatives, their overarching policy framework, and several other activities require a standardized, globally consistent, spatially explicit typology and terminology for managing the world’s ecosystems and their services.\n\n\n\nExisting global-scale ecological classifications were designed to meet different needs, not our current demand for ecosystem assessment. Several of these existing classifications have characteristics that are relevant to ecosystem assessment and management. The combination of intrinsic and utilitarian motives to conserve and manage ecosystems demands a typology that represents both ecological processes and the identity of their characteristic biota. Serving the policy needs requires scalable, systematic and mappable classification that defines ecosystem types consistently across the world. When reviewed, none of the 20 existing global-scale ecological classifications met these requirements. While many provided a useful representation of biogeographic patterns, most failed to incorporate ecological processes and functions and lacked a truly global scope encompassing all (terrestrial, freshwater and marine) components of the biosphere within a single framework. Representation of ecological processes is essential if a typology is to support generalizations about ecosystem responses to environmental change and management action. It is therefore critical to natural capital accounting, adaptive ecosystem management and sustainable management of ecosystem services, all of which depend on ecosystem functions.\n\n\n\nThe theoretical framework underpinning the typology is critical to ensuring classification robustness with a changing knowledge base plus the flexibility to accommodate new information. Future development will focus on mapping global distributions of ecosystem functional groups and developing linkages with established national classifications.

    "text": "Expert working groups for each realm delineated candidate ecosystem functional groups (Level 3) through a development and review process. They identified gradients in key assembly filters for each biome and identified major ecosystem and species traits that vary along them. In terrestrial environments, key assembly gradients include water deficit, seasonality, temperature, nutrient deficiency, fire activity and herbivory. In subterranean environments, substrate structure is a major factor. In freshwater environments, gradients in flow continuity and velocity, water body size, seasonal freezing and salinity are key assembly filters. In marine environments, depth gradients in light, vertical and horizontal movement of nutrients and substrate stability and particle size are major assembly filters.\nExperts delineated candidate functional groups by identifying distinctive sets of traits associated with particular segments of the assembly filter space defined by the gradients.\nFor each candidate ecosystem functional group, we represented the key drivers and traits in simplified conceptual models derived from the generic assembly model (Keith et al. in review) as a basis for review and description. We adjusted and augmented descriptions based on published reviews (see cited references in the descriptive profiles below) and in consultation with broader networks of specialists (e.g. through IUCN’s Commission on Ecosystem Management biome specialist groups.\nFinally, we prepared indicative global distribution maps from available spatial data. In some cases, high-resolution published maps were available (e.g. Murray et al. 2019). In other cases, we prepared coarse resolution maps using environmental proxies (e.g. Harris et al. 2004) or by identifying ecoregions documented as containing major or minor occurrences of ecosystem types referrable to respective functional groups (Spalding et al. 2007; Abell et al. 2008; Dinerstein et al. 2017). Occurrence information was gleaned from descriptions of ecoregions, references cited in the descriptive profiles for respective functional groups and personal observations of the authors.\nCheck the list of Ecosystem Functional Groups with links to their profiles."

    "section": "Descriptive profiles for Ecosystem Functional Groups",
    "text": "Descriptive profiles for Ecosystem Functional Groups\nThe descriptive profiles provide brief summaries of key ecological traits and processes for each functional group of ecosystems to enable any ecosystem type to be assigned to a group. The descriptions aim to identify explicit features that distinguish different functional groups to inform diagnosis and identification. However, there may be inherent uncertainties in assigning ecosystem types to unique functional groups because ecological classifications, in general, simplify complex variation in nature by segmenting and categorising fundamentally continuous gradients in multiple features. Thus, any given ecosystem type of interest may possess a suite of features that are typical of different functional groups. Users should apply weight of evidence to identify the most likely functional group, including distributional information, and report the nature of uncertainties.\n\nNomenclature\nNames of functional groups are vernacular, adopting names and descriptors frequently applied in the literature and reflecting key functional features. A vernacular, rather than systematic approach to nomenclature is intended to exploit terms (e.g. rainforest, lake, reef) that are familiar to a wide range of users, recognising regional variations and conventions in terminology.\n\n\nText descriptions\nThe text describes key ecological traits diagnosed from literature and expert knowledge that characterise each functional group and help distinguish it from other groups. The descriptions include ecosystem-level traits (e.g. productivity, energy sources, trophic structure, physical structure, bottom-up and top-down organisational processes, etc.) as well as species-level traits that are commonly represented among the component biota of ecosystem types within the group (e.g. life forms, life-history traits, specialised organs, characteristic behaviours and mobility, etc.). See Tables S4.1 and S4.2 for explanation of terms. Where possible, variability in traits is noted. The following table provides a brief glossary of selected terms used in the profiles (see Pérez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013 for further details on plant traits).\n\nA workbook with profile content for Ecosystem Functional Groups of the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology (Level 3 units) is available in an OSF repository.\n\n\nMajor ecosystem drivers\nThe text identifies key ecological drivers that shape the ecological character of ecosystem types within a functional group. These are primarily abiotic features and processes, including disturbance regimes that directly or indirectly influence resource availability. Human influence is only addressed in anthropogenic ecosystem functional groups, even though it profoundly affects most ecosystems on earth. These effects vary greatly in type, intensity and spatially in a manner that reflects social, cultural and economic norms and opportunities, technology and access, etc. as well as ecosystem characteristics. Specific influences of anthropogenic processes ecosystem state and will therefore be addressed in IUCN Red List assessments.\n\n\nDiagrammatic assembly models\nFor each Ecosystem Functional Group, the generic ecosystem assembly model  has been adapted to illustrate key ecological traits and assembly filters (drivers that shape ecosystem traits). Only the major features are shown and anthropogenic processes are only shown for anthropogenic functional groups (see below). Ecological traits are listed in green circles at centre, while drivers are identified in peripheral boxes (pale blue - resources, dark blue – ambient environmental factors that influence resource availability or uptake, red – environmental disturbance regimes, orange – biotic interactions, black – human activities). Connecting arrows show influences of, and interactions among drivers (only major connections shown, feedbacks generally not shown).\n\n\nIndicative distribution maps\nMaps are indicative of global distribution patterns are not intended to represent fine-scale patterns. The maps show areas of the world containing major (coloured red) or minor occurrences (coloured yellow) of each ecosystem functional group. Minor occurrences are areas where an ecosystem functional group is scattered in patches within matrices of other ecosystem functional groups or where they occur in substantial areas, but only within a segment of a larger region. Small but important occurrences are identified with an indicative black ellipse. Most maps were prepared using a coarse-scale template (e.g. ecoregions of Spalding et al. 2007; Abell et al. 2008; Dinerstein et al. 2017), but some were compiled from higher resolution spatial data where available (see details below). Higher resolution mapping is planned in future publications.\nWe emphasise that spatial representation of Ecosystem Functional Groups does not follow higher-order groupings described in respective ecoregion classifications (provinces of Spalding 2007; major habitat types of Abell et al. 2008; biomes of Olsen et al. 2001 and Dinerstein et al. 2017). Consequently, when Ecosystem Functional Groups are aggregated into functional biomes (Level 2 of the Global Ecosystem Typology), spatial patterns may differ from those of biogeogreaphic biomes as mapped by Olsen et al (2001) and Dinerstein et al. (2017). Differences reflect the distinctions between functional and biogeographic interpretations of the term, “biome” (Mucina 2018).\nIndicative maps are available in a data repository:\nKeith, David A., Ferrer-Paris, José R., Nicholson, Emily, & Kingsford, Richard T. (2023). Indicative distribution maps for Ecosystem Functional Groups - Level 3 of IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology (2.1.3) [Data set]. Zenodo. \n\n\nReferences\nKey references are listed as sources of further information for each functional group. Preference has been given to recent global reviews, and where these are not available, regional reviews or publications addressing key ecological processes that characterise the system."
