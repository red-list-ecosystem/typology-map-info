The biota includes aquatic and terrestrial species, and intertidal specialists. Large volumes of mangrove leaves and twigs are decomposed by fungi and bacteria, mobilising carbon and nutrients for invertebrates such as crabs, worms and snails. Shellfish and juvenile fish are protected from desiccation and predators amongst mangrove roots. Mangrove canopies support many terrestrial species, particularly birds. These forests are important carbon sinks, retaining organic matter in sediments and living biomass.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/MFT1.2>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***MFT1.2 Intertidal forests and shrublands***\n\nThe indicative map of Intertidal forests and shrublands (MFT1.2) was developed by resampling the known global distribution of mangrove forests for the year 2000 mapped by Giri et al. (2011). We used a buffer of 1km around the distribution data and a 30 arc second grid, thus large aggregations (> 1km<sup>2</sup>) are depicted as major occurrences, and the buffer areas with small occurrences are shown as minor occurrences. The original high-resolution data is available at [UNEP-WCMC](http://data.unep-wcmc.org/datasets/4)..\n\n **Map code and version**: MFT1.2.web.orig v2.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5091027](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5091027)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](MFT1_2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/MFT1_2_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/MFT1_2_history.qmd).\n\n",
