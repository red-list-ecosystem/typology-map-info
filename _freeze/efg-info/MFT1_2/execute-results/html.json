The biota includes aquatic and terrestrial species, and intertidal specialists. Large volumes of mangrove leaves and twigs are decomposed by fungi and bacteria, mobilising carbon and nutrients for invertebrates such as crabs, worms and snails. Shellfish and juvenile fish are protected from desiccation and predators amongst mangrove roots. Mangrove canopies support many terrestrial species, particularly birds. These forests are important carbon sinks, retaining organic matter in sediments and living biomass.\n\n### Key features\n\nIntertidal mangrove-dominated systems, producing high amounts of organic matter that is both buried in situ and exported; sediments dominated by detritivores and leaf shredders, with birds , mammals, reptiles and terrestrial invertebrates occupying the canopy.\n\n### Overview of distribution\n\nTropical and warm temperate coastlines with good sediment supply.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n## Map description\nThe indicative map of Intertidal forests and shrublands (MFT1.2) was developed by resampling the known global distribution of mangrove forests for the year 2000 mapped by Giri et al. (2011). We used a buffer of 1km around the distribution data and a 30 arc second grid, thus large aggregations (> 1km<sup>2</sup>) are depicted as major occurrences, and the buffer areas with small occurrences are shown as minor occurrences. The original high-resolution data is available at [UNEP-WCMC](http://data.unep-wcmc.org/datasets/4)..\n\n **Map code and version**: MFT1.2.web.orig v2.0.
