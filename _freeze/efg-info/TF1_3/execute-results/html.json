They are essentially treeless, with extensive reedbeds and aquatic grasses, interspersed with patches of open water. Food webs are strongly influenced by highly productive algae and plants, providing food for large numbers of invertebrates, waterbirds, reptiles, and mammals.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/TF1.3>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***TF1.3 Permanent marshes***\n\nTerrestrial ecoregions containing major or minor occurrences of this ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (Dinerstein et al. 2017), global and regional reviews, national and regional ecosystem maps, locations of relevant examples, and proofed by expert reviewers. Consequently they are coarse-scale indicative representations of distribution, except where they occupy small ecoregions. Ecoregions were mapped at 30 arc second spatial resolution..\n\n **Map code and version**: TF1.3.web.orig v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5091056](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5091056)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TF1_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/TF1_3_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/TF1_3_history.qmd).\n\n",
