Algae, floating plants and leaf fall support waterbugs, crustaceans and small fish making simple foodwebs with some locally restricted species found nowhere else. These ecosystems are sometimes important waterholes for birds and mammals, in otherwise dry landscapes.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/F2.8>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***F2.8 Artesian springs and oases***\n\nFreshwater ecoregions (Abell et al. 2008) were identified as containing occurrences of these functional groups if: i) their descriptions mentioned features consistent with those identified in the profile of the Ecosystem Functional Group; and ii) if their location was consistent with the ecological drivers described in the profile. Within those areas, locations of small lakes (<100km2), excluding artificial lakes (inclusion on types 1 and 3 only), were taken from the HydroLAKES database (Messager et al. 2016) and combined with global estimates of surface water phenology (classes 1, 2 and 7 from Pekel et al. 2016), occurrences were aggregated to 10 minutes spatial resolution..\n\n **Map code and version**: F2.8.web.mix v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5090958](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090958)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](F2_8_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/F2_8_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/F2_8_history.qmd).\n\n",
