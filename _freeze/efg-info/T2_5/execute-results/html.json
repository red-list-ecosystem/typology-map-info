The complex forest structure sustains a high diversity of birds, reptiles mammals, and canopy invertebrates, as well as a moist microclimate and deep, moist leaf litter on the forest floor that supports a diversity of soil invertebrates, fungi, and other microbes. These highly productive, fast-growing forests are notable carbon sinks, but extreme droughts make them prone to the most ferocious forest fires on earth at century-scale intervals. Seedbanks are crucial to the forest persisting after fire.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/T2.5>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***T2.5 Temperate pyric humid forests***\n\nRemote sensing estimates of canopy height were used as a direct indicator of the distribution of this group of tall forest ecosystems  (Armston et al. 2015, Hao et al. 2019). We selected all areas with tree canopies taller than 40m, and clipped to the spatial extent of temperate climate types (Beck et al. 2018). Mapped occurrences were then aggregated to half degree spatial resolution and reclassified as major occurrences (>20% of cell area) and minor occurrences (< 20% of cell area)..\n\n **Map code and version**: T2.5.web.alt v2.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5090427](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090427)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](T2_5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/T2_5_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/T2_5_history.qmd).\n\n",
