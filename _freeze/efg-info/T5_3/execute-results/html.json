Dry and very low nutrient conditions favour dominance of long-lived hard-leaved shrubs and hummock grasses. This vegetation concentrates scarce resources in patches that provide critical refuges for invertebrates, reptiles, ground-nesting birds and small mammals, whose digging activity contributes to nutrient cycling. Fires periodically liberate resources and restructure these ecosystems. Episodic rain storms regulated by regional climate cycles produce a ‘boom’ in productivity, with emergence of short-lived plants and high, but transient abundance of small mammals.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/T5.3>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***T5.3 Sclerophyll hot deserts and semi-deserts***\n\nMajor and minor occurrences were initially identified using consensus land-cover maps (Tuanmu et al. 2014) and then cropped to selected terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) at 30 arc seconds spatial resolution. Ecoregions were selected if: i) their descriptions mentioned features consistent with those identified in the profile of the Ecosystem Functional Group; and ii) if their location was consistent with the ecological drivers described in the profile..\n\n **Map code and version**: T5.3.web.mix v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5091007](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5091007)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](T5_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/T5_3_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/T5_3_history.qmd).\n\n",
