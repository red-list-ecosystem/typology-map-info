This group of productive deep sea ecosystems include: 1) hydrothermal vents on mid-ocean ridges and volcanically active seamounts, where temperatures may reach 400°C; 2) cold seeps typically on continental slopes; and 3) large organic falls of whales or wood. These specialised environments have high biomass but low diversity of organisms including microbes, tubeworms and shrimps, many of which are locally unique.\n\n### Key features\n\nSystems supported by microbial chemoautotrophy with high biomass of relatively low diversity, highly speciliased, fauna.\n\n### Overview of distribution\n\nHydrothermal vents, cold seeps, large organic falls on the deep seafloor.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n## Map description\nMajor occurrences of Chemosynthetic-based ecosystems was based on the distribution of hydrothermal vents on spreading plate boundaries mapped in ‘Plate lines and polygons’ data by USGS/ESRI. Occurrences were converted to 30 arc second spatial resolution. The distribution of cold seeps is poorly known and was not mapped..\n\n **Map code and version**: M3.7.web.orig v1.0.
