Filter feeders are most common in higher energy areas of currents and wave action. Primary producers are limited by substrate instability or light, with seagrass ecosystems (M1.1) occurring where these factors are not limiting to plant establishment and persistence. Low structural habitat complexity means a lack of shelter, and many organisms display predator avoidance traits like burrowing, shells or camouflage (e.g. sole).\n\n### Key features\n\nMedium to coarse-grained soft sediment with burrowing invertebrate detrivores and suspension-feeders mostly relying on allochthonous energy..\n\n### Overview of distribution\n\nContinental and island shelves.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n## Map description\nThese are ecosystem functional groups that are widespread through the global extent of the marine shelf biome. Reliable data on their precise distribution are limited. To represent regional uncertainty, their indicative distributions were mapped in as minor occurrences through the full extent of the marine ‘shelf’ base layer as mapped by Harris et al. (2014b). Occurrences were converted to 30 arc second spatial resolution..\n\n **Map code and version**: M1.7.web.orig v1.0.
