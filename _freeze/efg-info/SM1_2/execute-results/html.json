They are associated with carbonate substrates and lava flows on the coast and have a stronger terrestrial influence than other subterranean systems. Exposure to the surface enables algal primary producers to inhabit the water column and the benthos. Diversity and productivity of these aquatic ecosystems increases with age and connectivity to the sea. Some anchialine pools are highly insular, with molluscs and crustacean species found nowhere else.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/SM1.2>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***SM1.2 Anchialine pools***\n\nIndicative distributions of Anchialine caves and pools were based on mapped areas of carbonate rock outcrop (Williams & Ting Fong 2016) and lava flows intersecting the coast, which were aggregated within a template of 1-degree grid cells..\n\n **Map code and version**: SM1.2.web.grid v3.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5091035](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5091035)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](SM1_2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/SM1_2_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/SM1_2_history.qmd).\n\n",
