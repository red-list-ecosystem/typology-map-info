These are productive ecosystems with major energy and fine sediment inputs from floodplains and upper catchments. Zooplankton can be abundant, along with aquatic plants and diverse communities of fish able to tolerate a range of temperatures and oxygen concentrations, as well as reptiles, birds, and mammals that depend wholly or partly on lowland lotic aquatic habitats.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/F1.2>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***F1.2 Permanent lowland rivers***\n\nFreshwater ecoregions (Abell et al. 2008) were identified as containing occurrences of these functional groups if: i) their descriptions mentioned features consistent with those identified in the profile of the Ecosystem Functional Group; and ii) if their location was consistent with the ecological drivers described in the profile. Within these areas, major occurrences were mapped using stream orders 4-9 taken from the RiverATLAS (v1.0) database (Linke et al. 2019) combined with global estimates of surface water phenology (classes 1, 2 and 7 from Pekel et al. 2016). The remaining area of selected ecoregions was designated as minor occurrences..\n\n **Map code and version**: F1.2.web.map v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5090964](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090964)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](F1_2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/F1_2_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/F1_2_history.qmd).\n\n",
