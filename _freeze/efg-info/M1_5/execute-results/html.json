Low light due to depth, turbidity, ice cover or tannins from terrestrial runoff means that photosynthesis is limited to microphytobenthos (like microalgae and bacteria) or coralline algae. As a result, nutrient flux from surface waters is important. A high diversity of invertebrates and fish are also associated with these complex, three-dimensional forest-like habitats.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/M1.5>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***M1.5 Photo-limited marine animal forests***\n\nThese are ecosystem functional groups that are widespread through the global extent of the marine shelf biome. Reliable data on their precise distribution are limited. To represent regional uncertainty, their indicative distributions were mapped in as minor occurrences through the full extent of the marine ‘shelf’ base layer as mapped by Harris et al. (2014b). Occurrences were converted to 30 arc second spatial resolution..\n\n **Map code and version**: M1.5.web.orig v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5090933](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090933)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](M1_5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/M1_5_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/M1_5_history.qmd).\n\n",
