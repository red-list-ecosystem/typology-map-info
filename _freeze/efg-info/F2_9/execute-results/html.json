Mineral concentrations are therefore high and produce chemically precipitated substrates as waters cool. The extreme temperatures and water chemistry limit life to a low diversity of specialised bacteria, extensive algal mats and insect larvae which can live in warm acid or alkaline water with high mineral content. Away from their hottest waters, aquatic plants, crustaceans, frogs, fish, snakes and birds can all occur.\n\n### Key features\n\nHot springs, geysers and mud pots dependent on groundwater interactions with magma and hot rocks, supporting highly specialised low diversity biota tolerate of high temperatures and high concentrations of inorganic salts.\n\n### Overview of distribution\n\nTectonically or active volcanic areas from the tropical to subpolar latitudes.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n## Map description\nFreshwater ecoregions (Abell et al. 2008) were identified as containing occurrences of these functional groups if: i) their descriptions mentioned features consistent with those identified in the profile of the Ecosystem Functional Group; and ii) if their location was consistent with the ecological drivers described in the profile. Within those areas, locations of small lakes (<100km2), excluding artificial lakes (inclusion on types 1 and 3 only), were taken from the HydroLAKES database (Messager et al. 2016) and combined with global estimates of surface water phenology (classes 1, 2 and 7 from Pekel et al. 2016), occurrences were aggregated to 10 minutes spatial resolution..\n\n **Map code and version**: F2.9.web.mix v1.0.
