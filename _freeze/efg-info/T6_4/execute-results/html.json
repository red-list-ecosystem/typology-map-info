Seasonal productivity is limited by cold and snow cover, often with strong winds. Mosses, liverworts, lichens, flowering plants and low shrubs generally form a continuous cover, except where strong winds and dry conditions limit vegetation to sparse lichens and dwarf shrubs. Most fauna is seasonally active during warmer summer months, with insects and vertebrates having adaptations to extreme cold, including hibernation. Many species have restricted distributions, with strong barriers to dispersal between mountains.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/T6.4>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***T6.4 Temperate alpine grasslands and shrublands***\n\nTerrestrial ecoregions containing major or minor occurrences of this ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (Dinerstein et al. 2017), global and regional reviews, national and regional ecosystem maps, locations of relevant examples, and proofed by expert reviewers. Consequently they are coarse-scale indicative representations of distribution, except where they occupy small ecoregions. Ecoregions were mapped at 30 arc second spatial resolution..\n\n **Map code and version**: T6.4.web.orig v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5091077](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5091077)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](T6_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/T6_4_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/T6_4_history.qmd).\n\n",
