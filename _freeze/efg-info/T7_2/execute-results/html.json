Sown pastures are structurally simple ecosystems with low-diversity and high-productivity. They are dominated by one or few selected plant species as primary food sources for one animal species (usually large mammalian herbivores). Management includes chemical or physical treatments to exclude competitors, predators, herbivores, or pathogens. They differ from less intensively managed rangeland (e.g. T5.5) and semi-natural grasslands (T7.5), where livestock graze in predominantly native ecosystems.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/T7.2>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***T7.2 Sown pastures and fields***\n\nThe presence of sown pastures was approximated by selecting areas of overlap between existing irrigation infrastructure (Siebert et al. 2005; 2013) and presence of major livestock (Gilbert et al. 2018)..\n\n **Map code and version**: T7.2.web.map v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5091081](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5091081)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](T7_2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/T7_2_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/T7_2_history.qmd).\n\n",
