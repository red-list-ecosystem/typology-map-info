Bursts of primary productivity are associated with naturally variable, often wind-driven upwelling events and support a very high biomass of plankton, fish, and marine birds and mammals. Small species like sardine and anchovy that operate at low trophic levels dominate fish communities, may vary greatly in abundance through time, and play important roles in food webs.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/M1.9>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***M1.9 Upwelling zones***\n\nMarine ecoregions (Spalding et al. 2008) with major and minor occurrences of Upwelling zones were identified by consulting global and regional reviews (cited in descriptive profile), maps of relevant ecosystems and expertise of authors, proofed by specialist reviewers. The identified ecoregions were then clipped to the extent of the marine ‘shelf’ base layer as mapped by Harris et al. (2014b). Occurrences were converted to 30 arc second spatial resolution..\n\n **Map code and version**: M1.9.web.orig v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5090941](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090941)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](M1_9_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/M1_9_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/M1_9_history.qmd).\n\n",
