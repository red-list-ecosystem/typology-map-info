Microbial mats composed of bacteria and aquatic fungi on submerged rock surfaces are major food sources for protozoans and invertebrates, especially in systems that are isolated from surface waters. Larger water bodies support predatory fish. When connectivity is strong, inflow brings a supply of nutrients and organic matter, as well as itinerant biota.\n\n### Key features\n\nWater-filled subterranean voids with low diversity of light-limited bacteria, fungi, detrivores and predators..\n\n### Overview of distribution\n\nScattered lobally in limestone or more rarely basalt or other lithic substrates.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n## Map description\nDistributions of Underground streams and pools were based on mapped area of carbonate rock outcrop (Williams & Ting Fong 2016). This. provides an upper limit on the area of exposed karst terrain, as not all carbonate rocks are karstified. Lava tubes and other rocks that may contain these ecosystem functional groups are not shown on this indicative map, but are less extensive than those in carbonate rock..\n\n **Map code and version**: SF1.1.web.orig v1.0.
