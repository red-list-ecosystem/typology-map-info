Microbial mats composed of bacteria and aquatic fungi on submerged rock surfaces are major food sources for protozoans and invertebrates, especially in systems that are isolated from surface waters. Larger water bodies support predatory fish. When connectivity is strong, inflow brings a supply of nutrients and organic matter, as well as itinerant biota.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/SF1.1>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***SF1.1 Underground streams and pools***\n\nDistributions of Underground streams and pools were based on mapped area of carbonate rock outcrop (Williams & Ting Fong 2016). This. provides an upper limit on the area of exposed karst terrain, as not all carbonate rocks are karstified. Lava tubes and other rocks that may contain these ecosystem functional groups are not shown on this indicative map, but are less extensive than those in carbonate rock..\n\n **Map code and version**: SF1.1.web.orig v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5091043](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5091043)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](SF1_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/SF1_1_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/SF1_1_history.qmd).\n\n",
