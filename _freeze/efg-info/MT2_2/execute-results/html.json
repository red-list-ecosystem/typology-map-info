These animals consume large amounts of marine resources but spend many weeks and months on land, accumulating high concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorous and other nutrients. The abundance and relatively large body size of individuals disrupt the growth of vegetation. The combination of these factors means that microbial activity is high and soil invertebrates are abundant, but plant diversity is usually low, and land based grazers and predators are usually absent.\n\n### Key features\n\nLocalised areas of bare or vegetated ground with diverse microbial communities at the ocean interface receiving massive nutrient subsidies and disturbance from large concentrations of roosting or nesting seabirds and pinnipeds that function as mobile links between land and sea.\n\n### Overview of distribution\n\nScattered globally on islands and coastlines, but most common in polar and subpolar regions.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n## Map description\nWe used spatial data on Nitrogen (N) and Phosphor (P) deposition from seabird colonies (Otero et al. 2018) as an indicators of the distribution of this functional group. Original point data was in decimal degrees rounded to 6 arc-min resolution, for the maps we aggregated data to square grid cells of 250 km. We used a threshold of >1000 and <100000 kg/yr N to select minor occurrences and a threshold of >100000 kg/yr N for major occurrences..\n\n **Map code and version**: MT2.2.IM.orig v1.0.
