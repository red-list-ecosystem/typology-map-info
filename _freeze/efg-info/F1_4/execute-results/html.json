Globally, these streams account for the greatest stream length of any flowing ecosystem. During the dry season, flows in some streams are reduced to very levels, while in others flow ceases altogether and water persists only in isolated stagnant pools. Algae and leaf fall support moderate productivity, with seasonal floods sending organic matter downstream. The diversity of organisms fluctuates seasonally, with many localised (endemic) species, and specialised adaptations that enable animals to survive both flooding and dry conditions.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/F1.4>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***F1.4 Seasonal upland streams***\n\nFreshwater ecoregions (Abell et al. 2008) were identified as containing occurrences of these functional groups if: i) their descriptions mentioned features consistent with those identified in the profile of the Ecosystem Functional Group; and ii) if their location was consistent with the ecological drivers described in the profile. Within the selected ecoregions, major occurrences were mapped using 1st-4th order streams (3km buffer) taken from the RiverATLAS (v1.0) database (Linke et al. 2019). The remaining areas of selected ecoregions were mapped as minor occurrences..\n\n **Map code and version**: F1.4.web.map v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5090968](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090968)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](F1_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/F1_4_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/F1_4_history.qmd).\n\n",
