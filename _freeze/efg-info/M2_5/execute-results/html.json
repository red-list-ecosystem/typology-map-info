The sea-ice itself provides habitat for ice-dependent species, such as the microalgal and microbial communities that form the basis of communities in waters below, while plankton, fish and marine birds and mammals feed on and around the ice. Sea-ice plays a crucial role in both pelagic marine ecosystems and biogeochemical processes like ocean-atmosphere gas exchange.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/M2.5>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***M2.5 Sea ice***\n\nIndicative distributions of sea ice were obtained from Fetterer et al. (2017). To approximate the maximum annual global extent, we used the monthly extent for March 2019 for the northern hemisphere, and the monthly extent for September 2018 for the southern hemisphere. Occurrences were mapped at 30 arc second spatial resolution..\n\n **Map code and version**: M2.5.web.orig v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5090920](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090920)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](M2_5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/M2_5_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/M2_5_history.qmd).\n\n",
