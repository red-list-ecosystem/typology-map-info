Cold winters with occasional to frequent snow and frost limit the growing season, but hot dry summers create water stress. Nonetheless, fertile soils enable high productivity after rains, supporting a complex foodweb of invertebrates, ground-nesting birds, burrowing mammals, large herbivores, reptiles and predators. Large herbivores graze heavily, range widely, and are important in maintaining coexistence of plant species and nutrient cycling, as are periodic fires.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/T4.5>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***T4.5 Temperate subhumid grasslands***\n\nTerrestrial ecoregions containing major or minor occurrences of this ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (Dinerstein et al. 2017), global and regional reviews, national and regional ecosystem maps, locations of relevant examples, and proofed by expert reviewers. Consequently they are coarse-scale indicative representations of distribution, except where they occupy small ecoregions. Ecoregions were mapped at 30 arc second spatial resolution..\n\n **Map code and version**: T4.5.web.orig v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.10068009](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10068009)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](T4_5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/T4_5_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/T4_5_history.qmd).\n\n",
