Littoral vegetation and benthic energy pathways are critical to productivity and food web complexity. Deep lakes have plankton, supporting fish, birds and frogs, in different habitats of the lake. Shallow lakes are often more productive, providing breeding habitat for birds, frogs and reptiles, but limited buffering against nutrient inputs may result in regime shifts between alternative stable states dominated either by large aquatic plants or phytoplankton.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/F2.2>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***F2.2 Small permanent freshwater lakes***\n\nFreshwater ecoregions (Abell et al. 2008) were identified as containing occurrences of these functional groups if: i) their descriptions mentioned features consistent with those identified in the profile of the Ecosystem Functional Group; and ii) if their location was consistent with the ecological drivers described in the profile. Within those areas, locations of small lakes (<100km2), excluding artificial lakes (inclusion on types 1 and 3 only), were taken from the HydroLAKES database (Messager et al. 2016) and combined with global estimates of surface water phenology (classes 1, 2 and 7 from Pekel et al. 2016), occurrences were aggregated to 10 minutes spatial resolution..\n\n **Map code and version**: F2.2.web.mix v2.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5090945](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090945)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](F2_2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/F2_2_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/F2_2_history.qmd).\n\n",
