In winter, the layer of surface ice reduces nutrient inputs and light penetration, limiting the productivity of these ecosystems and the diversity of their biota. In spring, meltwaters transport increased organic matter and nutrients, producing seasonal peaks in abundance of algae and phytoplankton.  Animals, such as fish and beavers, tolerate near-freezing water temperatures, while a range of invertebrates and other vertebrates come to forage from spring to autumn.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/F1.3>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***F1.3 Freeze-thaw rivers and streams***\n\nThe distribution of freeze-thaw rivers and streams was mapped from the Global River Classification database (Ouellet Dallaire et al. 2018), including all reaches with with minimum temperature below 0Â°C..\n\n **Map code and version**: F1.3.web.map v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.10056414](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10056414)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](F1_3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/F1_3_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/F1_3_history.qmd).\n\n",
