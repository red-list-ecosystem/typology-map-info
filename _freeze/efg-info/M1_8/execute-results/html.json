Unlike subtidal sand beds (M1.7), the microbial community has a strong influence on biogeochemical cycles. Low oxygen zones can form where concentrations of organic matter and associated high bacterial activity deplete this limited resource.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/M1.8>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***M1.8 Subtidal mud plains***\n\nThese are ecosystem functional groups that are widespread through the global extent of the marine shelf biome. Reliable data on their precise distribution are limited. To represent regional uncertainty, their indicative distributions were mapped in as minor occurrences through the full extent of the marine ‘shelf’ base layer as mapped by Harris et al. (2014b). Occurrences were converted to 30 arc second spatial resolution..\n\n **Map code and version**: M1.8.web.orig v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5090939](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090939)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](M1_8_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/M1_8_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/M1_8_history.qmd).\n\n",
