Their very large flow volumes, diverse habitats and slow to moderate flows make them highly productive. High nutrient levels come from upstream catchments and floodplains, with additional productivity contributed by in-channel algae and aquatic plants. Their food webs are complex, with a high diversity of plants and animals, including large-bodied fish, reptiles and mammals.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/F1.7>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***F1.7 Large lowland rivers***\n\nThe distribution of large lowland rivers was taken from the Global River Classification database (Ouellet Dallaire et al. 2018). Reaches with flow > 10,000 m3/s were mapped with a 20 km buffer as major occurrences, clipped to exclude those with seasonal freezing temperatures (mean temperature of coldest quarter <0Â°C)..\n\n **Map code and version**: F1.7.web.orig v2.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5090974](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090974)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](F1_7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/F1_7_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/F1_7_history.qmd).\n\n",
