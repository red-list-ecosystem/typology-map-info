The lakes are dry and salt-encrusted most of the time, but episodic inundation dilutes salt, allowing high growth of algae and larger plants which support crustaceans, insect larvae, fish and specialist waterbirds. These species use dormant life stages to survive drying, or disperse rapidly to other habitats when the lake dries.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/F2.7>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***F2.7 Ephemeral salt lakes***\n\nLocation of ephemeral lakes was taken from global lake databases (Lehner and DÃ¶ll 2004; types 1 and 3 from Messager et al. 2016), intersected with estimates of ephemeral surface water (classes 9 and 10 from Pekel et al. 2016) and the distribution of arid and semi-arid, endorheic basins (Linke et al. 2019). Occurrences were aggregated to 10 minutes spatial resolution.
