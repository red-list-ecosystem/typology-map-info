Dominated by tussock grasses that grow tall during high-productivity wet summers and cure over dry winter seasons, these ecosystems occur on all major land masses at tropical and subtropical latitudes around the world. Large mammalian herbivores are usually present, but not at densities that limit grass growth or mediate tree-grass coexistence (unlike T4.1). Many plants have traits that promote  tolerate of seasonal drought, such as deciduous leaf phenology, subterranean storage organs and deep roots. Invertebrate detritivores, notably termites,  and vertebrate scavengers are key groups in the foodweb.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/T4.2>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***T4.2 Pyric tussock savannas***\n\nTerrestrial ecoregions containing major or minor occurrences of this ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (Dinerstein et al. 2017), global and regional reviews, national and regional ecosystem maps, locations of relevant examples, and proofed by expert reviewers. Consequently they are coarse-scale indicative representations of distribution, except where they occupy small ecoregions. Ecoregions were mapped at 30 arc second spatial resolution..\n\n **Map code and version**: T4.2.web.orig v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5091021](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5091021)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](T4_2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/T4_2_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/T4_2_history.qmd).\n\n",
