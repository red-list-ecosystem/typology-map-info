They occur in warm, shallow, low-nutrient waters and provide complex three-dimensional habitat for a highly diverse community across all trophic levels, from algae to sharks, along with other characteristic sessile organisms like coralline algae and sponges. Niche habitats produce specialist behaviours and diets, like the symbiotic relationship between clown fish and anemones. Storms and marine heat waves drive cycles of reef destruction and renewal.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/M1.3>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***M1.3 Photic coral reefs***\n\nIndicative maps of Photic coral reefs were obtained from Institute for Marine Remote Sensing et al.
