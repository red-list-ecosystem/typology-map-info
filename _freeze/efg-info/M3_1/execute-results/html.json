Nutrients falling from upper ocean layers and delivered by currents from the shelf support diverse communities of microbial decomposers, detritivores like crabs and demersal fish, and their predators, but sessile animals are rare and algae are absent. Biomass is relatively low and peaks at mid-slope, diminishing with depth as food and temperature decrease and bathymetric pressure increases.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/M3.1>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***M3.1 Continental and island slopes***\n\nMajor occurrences of continental and island slopes was based on the ‘slope’ geomorphic unit of Harris et al.
