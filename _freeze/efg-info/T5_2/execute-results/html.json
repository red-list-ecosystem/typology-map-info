They have a sparse cover of typical cactus-like plants and other slow-growing spiny and succulent species, on stony low-nutrient soils. Many of these plants store water in their stems and have deep roots. Short-lived plant species emerge after rains from dormant organs or soil seed banks. Plants and animals tolerate extreme summer temperatures and mild winters. Nocturnal and burrowing mammals are able to avoid extreme temperatures. Diverse opportunistic invertebrates and reptiles occur, along with small numbers of large-ranging ungulates.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/T5.2>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***T5.2 Succulent or Thorny deserts and semi-deserts***\n\nMajor and minor occurrences were initially identified using consensus land-cover maps (Tuanmu et al. 2014) and then cropped to selected terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) at 30 arc seconds spatial resolution. Ecoregions were selected if: i) their descriptions mentioned features consistent with those identified in the profile of the Ecosystem Functional Group; and ii) if their location was consistent with the ecological drivers described in the profile..\n\n **Map code and version**: T5.2.web.mix v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5091005](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5091005)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](T5_2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/T5_2_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/T5_2_history.qmd).\n\n",
