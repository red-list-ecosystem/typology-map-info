Analogues in icy environments belong to T6.2. Productivity and diversity are consequently low. Lichens and mosses are often abundant and important to ecosystem development, slowly building soils through incremental retention of moisture and nutrients. Successional development of soils and vegetation may be interrupted by landslides, eruptions and other mass movements. Small-leaved pioneer shrubs and grasses are sparse, often growing in crevices. The simple foodwebs are comprised mainly of microbes and itinerant organisms, with few resident vertebrates other than reptiles and ground-nesting birds.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/T3.4>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***T3.4 Young rocky pavements, lava flows and screes***\n\nMajor and minor occurrences were initially identified using consensus land-cover maps (Tuanmu et al. 2014) and then cropped to selected terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) at 30 arc seconds spatial resolution. Ecoregions were selected if: i) their descriptions mentioned features consistent with those identified in the profile of the Ecosystem Functional Group; and ii) if their location was consistent with the ecological drivers described in the profile..\n\n **Map code and version**: T3.4.web.mix v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5091111](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5091111)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](T3_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/T3_4_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/T3_4_history.qmd).\n\n",
