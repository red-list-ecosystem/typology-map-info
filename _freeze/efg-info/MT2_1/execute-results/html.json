Plants, for example, exhibit traits such as succulence and rhizomes to promote persistence in these conditions, and many organisms are widely dispersed by winds or ocean currents. Consumers like seabirds or seals move between terrestrial and marine environments.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/MT2.1>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***MT2.1 Coastal shrublands and grasslands***\n\nCoastlines were mapped with a 5 km buffer applied between 60°S and 60°N..\n\n **Map code and version**: MT2.1.web.map v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5091113](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5091113)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](MT2_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/MT2_1_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/MT2_1_history.qmd).\n\n",
