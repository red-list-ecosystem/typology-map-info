They are landscape sponges, with highly specialised plant life including shrubs, sedges and mosses equipped to grow in acidic, nutrient-poor, low-oxygen, waterlogged soils. Sphagnum moss and other peat-forming plants are foundational to these ecosystems. Insects are the dominant animal group, along with amphibians, reptiles, rodents and a few visiting birds.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/TF1.6>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***TF1.6 Boreal, temperate and montane peat bogs***\n\nTerrestrial ecoregions containing major or minor occurrences of this ecosystem functional group were identified by consulting available ecoregion descriptions (Dinerstein et al. 2017), global and regional reviews, national and regional ecosystem maps, locations of relevant examples, and proofed by expert reviewers. Consequently they are coarse-scale indicative representations of distribution, except where they occupy small ecoregions. Ecoregions were mapped at 30 arc second spatial resolution..\n\n **Map code and version**: TF1.6.web.orig v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5091062](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5091062)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TF1_6_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/TF1_6_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/TF1_6_history.qmd).\n\n",
