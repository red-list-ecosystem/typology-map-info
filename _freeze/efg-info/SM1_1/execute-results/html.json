These ecosystems are structured by strong salinity gradients. A primarily marine community influenced by tides and currents at the cave entrance transitioning to a more insular and specialised biota in still brackish waters influenced by rainfall percolation deep in the landward section of the cave.  They occur where carbonate rocks and lava tubes meet coastlines worldwide.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/SM1.1>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***SM1.1 Anchialine caves***\n\nIndicative distributions of Anchialine caves and pools were based on mapped areas of carbonate rock outcrop (Williams & Ting Fong 2016) and lava flows intersecting the coast, which were aggregated within a template of 1-degree grid cells..\n\n **Map code and version**: SM1.1.web.grid v3.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5091031](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5091031)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](SM1_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/SM1_1_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/SM1_1_history.qmd).\n\n",
