They are filled by rainfall or river water diversions. Their levees and channels retain shallow water areas, with nutrients inputs from inflows and fertilisers. Planting and harvest establishes a regular cycle of disturbance, with many paddies also supporting production of fish and crustaceans, Their simple foodwebs are adapted to temporary flooding and the harvest cycle, including algae and plankton, waterbugs, frogs and waterbirds.\n\n### Key features\n\nArtificial wetlands with limited horizontal and vertical heterogeneity, filled seasonally with water from rivers or rainfall and frequently disturbed by planting and harvest of rice. Simple trophic networks with colonists from rivers and wetlands that may also include managed fish populations.\n\n### Overview of distribution\n\nMostly in tropical and subtropical southeastand south Asia, also in Africa, Europe, South America, North America and southeast Australia.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n## Map description\nThe distribution of rice paddies was estimated from the percentage of rice cover at a 5 arc minute  resolution based on Monfreda et al. (2008). Cells with > 10% rice cover were designated as major occurrences, and those with 1-10% rice cover were designated as minor occurrences..\n\n **Map code and version**: F3.3.web.alt v2.0.
