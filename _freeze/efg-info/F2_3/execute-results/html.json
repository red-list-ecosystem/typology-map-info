Lakes biome\"\nparams:\n efgcode: F2.3\ncategories:\n - F2\nformat:\n html: default\nexecute:\n   echo: false\n---\n## Profile summary \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nFull profile at <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/F2.3>{target='GET'}\n\n### Brief description\nSmall seasonal lakes, pools and rock holes have plants and animals specialised to seasonally changing wet and dry conditions in temperate and wet-dry tropical regions. Their energy comes mostly from algae and plants. To survive the annual wet/dry cycles, the animals and plants have dormant life stages, such as eggs or seeds, within the lake sediments, or they shelter in damp burrows or other refuges. Plants and animals can build up high abundances during wet seasons, supporting plankton and waterbugs, frogs, birds and mammals but, in most cases, no fish.\n\n### Key features\n\nMostly small and shallow well mixed freshwater lakes with seasonal patterns of filling and seasonally variable abundance and composition of aquatic biota, including species with dormant life phases and some that retreat to refuges in dry seasons.\n\n### Overview of distribution\n\nMainly subhumid temperate (including Mediterranean-type climate zones) and wet-dry tropical regions.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n## Map description\nFreshwater ecoregions (Abell et al. 2008) were identified as containing occurrences of these functional groups if: i) their descriptions mentioned features consistent with those identified in the profile of the Ecosystem Functional Group; and ii) if their location was consistent with the ecological drivers described in the profile. Within those areas, locations of small lakes (<100km2), excluding artificial lakes (inclusion on types 1 and 3 only), were taken from the HydroLAKES database (Messager et al. 2016) and combined with global estimates of surface water phenology (classes 1, 2 and 7 from Pekel et al. 2016), occurrences were aggregated to 10 minutes spatial resolution..\n\n **Map code and version**: F2.3.web.mix v2.0.
