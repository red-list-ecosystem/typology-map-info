Large forest trees provide habitat for fungi, mosses and liverworts. Seasonal understorey growth sustains high densities of herbivores such as bear, deer, and a variety of insects, with predators such as lynx, wolves and raptors. Plants and animals survive cold winters through freeze-tolerant organs, hibernation or migratory movements.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/T2.1>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***T2.1 Boreal and temperate high montane forests and woodlands***\n\nMajor and minor occurrences were initially identified using consensus land-cover maps (Tuanmu et al. 2014) and then cropped to selected terrestrial ecoregions (Dinerstein et al. 2017) at 30 arc seconds spatial resolution. Ecoregions were selected if: i) their descriptions mentioned features consistent with those identified in the profile of the Ecosystem Functional Group; and ii) if their location was consistent with the ecological drivers described in the profile..\n\n **Map code and version**: T2.1.web.mix v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5091097](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5091097)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](T2_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/T2_1_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/T2_1_history.qmd).\n\n",
