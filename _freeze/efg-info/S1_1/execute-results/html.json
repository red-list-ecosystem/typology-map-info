Food chains consequently lack plants and herbivores. Microbes in biofilms are the dominant life forms, but some caves have invertebrate detritivore and predators, or temporary vertebrate inhabitants. Their limited energy comes from organic material imported by seepage or animal movements, and bacteria that synthesise chemical energy from rocks. They are found on all major land masses, most commonly in carbonate rocks or lava tubes.\n\nRead more about this functional group at: <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/S1.1>{target=\"webapp\"}\n\n## Map description\n***S1.1 Aerobic caves***\n\nDistributions of Aerobic caves were based on mapped area of carbonate rock outcrop (Williams & Ting Fong 2016). This. provides an upper limit on the area of exposed karst terrain, as not all carbonate rocks are karstified. Lava tubes and other rocks that may contain these ecosystem functional groups are not shown on this indicative map, but are less extensive than those in carbonate rock..\n\n **Map code and version**: S1.1.web.orig v1.0. **GIS data (raster and vector format) available at** DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.5091117](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5091117)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](S1_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nRead more details about this map [here](/map-info/S1_1_valid.qmd).\n\nRead more details about older versions of this map [here](/map-info/S1_1_history.qmd).\n\n",
