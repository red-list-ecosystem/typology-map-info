Within those areas, locations of small lakes (<100km2), excluding artificial lakes (inclusion on types 1 and 3 only), were taken from the HydroLAKES database (Messager et al. 2016) and combined with global estimates of surface water phenology (classes 1, 2 and 7 from Pekel et al. 2016), occurrences were aggregated to 10 minutes spatial resolution..\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nYou can download and use this file from the following sources:\n\n- GitHub repository ([GeoJSON / TopoJSON versions in GitHUB](https://github.com/red-list-ecosystem/typology-map-data/blob/master/data/layers/F2.3.web.mix_v2.0_topo.json))\n - Zenodo repository (EFG map) ([Includes GeoTIFF, GeoJSON and PNG files](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090947))\n - Zenodo repository (bundle of maps) ([Includes GeoTIFF, GeoJSON and PNG versions in compressed file](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090419))\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nThis section provides information about the valid indicative distribution map for the ecosystem functional group [**F2.3 Seasonal freshwater lakes**](/efg-info/F2_3.qmd).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n## Available maps\n\nThese maps are considered current and valid indicative distribution maps for this ecosystem functional group.\n\n- Web navigation (**code: F2.3.web.mix**, version v2.0) \n - Indicative Map (**code: F2.3.IM.mix**, version v2.0) \n\n## Map files\n\nYou can download geospatial data for this map from the following sources:\n\nF2.3.web.mix (v2.0){target=\"gisdata\"}: [GitHub repository](F2.3.web.mix_v2.0_topo.json) :: [Google Cloud bucket](gs://iucn_get_l3_im/F2.3.web.mix_v2.0.tif) :: [Zenodo repository (bundle of maps)](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090419) :: [Zenodo repository (EFG map)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090947) :: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/red-list-ecosystem/typology-map-data/blob/master/data/layers/F2.3.web.mix_v2.0_topo.json) :: [GitHub repository](layers/F2.3.web.mix_v2.0_topo.json) :: [Earth Engine assets](projects/earthengine-legacy/assets/users/jrferrerparis/IUCN-GET/L3_IndMaps/)\nF2.3.IM.mix (v2.0){target=\"gisdata\"}: [Google Cloud bucket](gs://iucn_get_l3_im/F2.3.IM.mix_v2.0.tif) :: [Zenodo repository (bundle of maps)](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3958934)\n\nNote that you need to login to some services like [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com){target=\"links\"} or [earthengine](https://earthengine.google.com){target=\"links\"}, and in some cases you also need to request access to the files.\n\n",
