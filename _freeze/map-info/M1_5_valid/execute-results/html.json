Reliable data on their precise distribution are limited. To represent regional uncertainty, their indicative distributions were mapped in as minor occurrences through the full extent of the marine ‘shelf’ base layer as mapped by Harris et al. (2014b). Occurrences were converted to 30 arc second spatial resolution..\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nYou can download and use this file from the following sources:\n\n- Mapbox tileset ([GeoTIFF version uploaded to Mapbox](https://studio.mapbox.com/tilesets/jrfep.M1_5_web_orig))\n - Zenodo repository (EFG map) ([Includes GeoTIFF, GeoJSON and PNG files](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090933))\n - Zenodo repository (bundle of maps) ([Includes GeoTIFF, GeoJSON and PNG versions in compressed file](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090419))\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nThis section provides information about the valid indicative distribution map for the ecosystem functional group [**M1.5 Photo-limited marine animal forests**](/efg-info/M1_5.qmd).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n## Available maps\n\nThese maps are considered current and valid indicative distribution maps for this ecosystem functional group.\n\n- Indicative Map (**code: M1.5.IM.orig**, version v1.0) \n - Web navigation (**code: M1.5.web.orig**, version v1.0) \n\n## Map files\n\nYou can download geospatial data for this map from the following sources:\n\nM1.5.IM.orig (v1.0){target=\"gisdata\"}: [Google Cloud bucket](gs://iucn_get_l3_im/M1.5.IM.orig_v1.0.tif) :: [Zenodo repository (bundle of maps)](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3958934)\nM1.5.web.orig (v1.0){target=\"gisdata\"}: [Google Cloud bucket](gs://iucn_get_l3_im/M1.5.web.orig_v1.0.tif) :: [Zenodo repository (bundle of maps)](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090419) :: [Zenodo repository (EFG map)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090933) :: [Mapbox tileset](https://studio.mapbox.com/tilesets/jrfep.M1_5_web_orig) :: [Earth Engine assets](projects/earthengine-legacy/assets/users/jrferrerparis/IUCN-GET/L3_IndMaps/)\n\nNote that you need to login to some services like [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com){target=\"links\"} or [earthengine](https://earthengine.google.com){target=\"links\"}, and in some cases you also need to request access to the files.\n\n",
