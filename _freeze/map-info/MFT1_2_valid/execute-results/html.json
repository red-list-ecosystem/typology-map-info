(2011). We used a buffer of 1km around the distribution data and a 30 arc second grid, thus large aggregations (> 1km<sup>2</sup>) are depicted as major occurrences, and the buffer areas with small occurrences are shown as minor occurrences. The original high-resolution data is available at [UNEP-WCMC](http://data.unep-wcmc.org/datasets/4)..\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nYou can download and use this file from the following sources:\n\n- Zenodo repository (EFG map) ([Includes GeoTIFF, GeoJSON and PNG files](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5091027))\n - Zenodo repository (bundle of maps) ([Includes GeoTIFF, GeoJSON and PNG versions in compressed file](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090419))\n - Mapbox tileset ([GeoTIFF version uploaded to Mapbox](https://studio.mapbox.com/tilesets/jrfep.MFT1_2_web_orig))\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nThis section provides information about the valid indicative distribution map for the ecosystem functional group [**MFT1.2 Intertidal forests and shrublands**](/efg-info/MFT1_2.qmd).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n## Available maps\n\nThese maps are considered current and valid indicative distribution maps for this ecosystem functional group.\n\n- Indicative Map (**code: MFT1.2.WM.nwx**, version v1.0) \n\n## Map files\n\nYou can download geospatial data for this map from the following sources:\n\nMFT1.2.WM.nwx (v1.0){target=\"gisdata\"}: [Google Cloud bucket](gs://iucn_get_l3_im/MFT1.2.WM.nwx_v1.0.tif) :: [Mapbox tileset](https://studio.mapbox.com/tilesets/jrfep.MFT1_2_WM_nwx)\n\nNote that you need to login to some services like [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com){target=\"links\"} or [earthengine](https://earthengine.google.com){target=\"links\"}, and in some cases you also need to request access to the files.\n\n",
