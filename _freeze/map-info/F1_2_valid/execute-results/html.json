Within these areas, major occurrences were mapped using stream orders 4-9 taken from the RiverATLAS (v1.0) database (Linke et al. 2019) combined with global estimates of surface water phenology (classes 1, 2 and 7 from Pekel et al. 2016). The remaining area of selected ecoregions was designated as minor occurrences..\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nYou can download and use this file from the following sources:\n\n- Mapbox tileset ([GeoTIFF version uploaded to Mapbox](https://studio.mapbox.com/tilesets/jrfep.F1_2_web_map))\n - Zenodo repository (EFG map) ([Includes GeoTIFF, GeoJSON and PNG files](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090964))\n - Zenodo repository (bundle of maps) ([Includes GeoTIFF, GeoJSON and PNG versions in compressed file](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090419))\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nThis section provides information about the valid indicative distribution map for the ecosystem functional group [**F1.2 Permanent lowland rivers**](/efg-info/F1_2.qmd).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n## Available maps\n\nThese maps are considered current and valid indicative distribution maps for this ecosystem functional group.\n\n- Indicative Map (**code: F1.2.IM.grid**, version v1.0) \n - Web navigation (**code: F1.2.web.map**, version v1.0) \n\n## Map files\n\nYou can download geospatial data for this map from the following sources:\n\nF1.2.IM.grid (v1.0){target=\"gisdata\"}: [Google Cloud bucket](gs://iucn_get_l3_im/F1.2.IM.grid_v1.0.tif) :: [Zenodo repository (bundle of maps)](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3958934)\nF1.2.web.map (v1.0){target=\"gisdata\"}: [Google Cloud bucket](gs://iucn_get_l3_im/F1.2.web.map_v1.0.tif) :: [Zenodo repository (bundle of maps)](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090419) :: [Zenodo repository (EFG map)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090964) :: [Mapbox tileset](https://studio.mapbox.com/tilesets/jrfep.F1_2_web_map) :: [Earth Engine assets](projects/earthengine-legacy/assets/users/jrferrerparis/IUCN-GET/L3_IndMaps/)\n\nNote that you need to login to some services like [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com){target=\"links\"} or [earthengine](https://earthengine.google.com){target=\"links\"}, and in some cases you also need to request access to the files.\n\n",
