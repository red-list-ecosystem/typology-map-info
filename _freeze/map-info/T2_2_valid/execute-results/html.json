Ecoregions were selected if: i) their descriptions mentioned features consistent with those identified in the profile of the Ecosystem Functional Group; and ii) if their location was consistent with the ecological drivers described in the profile..\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nYou can download and use this file from the following sources:\n\n- raster map in repository ([GeoTIFF version uploaded to Mapbox](https://studio.mapbox.com/tilesets/jrfep.T2_2_web_mix))\n - raster/vector files in repository ([Includes GeoTIFF, GeoJSON and PNG versions in compressed file](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090419))\n - individual raster/vector files in Zenodo ([Includes GeoTIFF, GeoJSON and PNG files](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5091099))\n\n",
