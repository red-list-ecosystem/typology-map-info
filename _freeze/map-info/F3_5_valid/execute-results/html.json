For older or alternative maps, see [here](/map-info/F3_5_history.qmd).\n\n## Methods\n\nHere is the methods summary for **Map code and version**: F3.5.web.orig v1.0.\n\n> Freshwater ecoregions (Abell et al. 2008) were identified as containing major or minor occurrences of these functional groups if: i) their descriptions mentioned features consistent with those identifed in the profile of the Ecosystem Functional Group; and ii) if their location was consistent with the ecological drivers described in the profile. The selections were check by expert reviewers. Occurrences were mapped at 30 arc seconds spatial resolution.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n### Datasets\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|dataset |url |\n|:-------|:---|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n### Processing\n\nProcessing steps used in this map are: *NA*.\n\n### Map evaluation\n\n\nThis map is considered to be a ***Fine quality map series*** based on the following characteristics:\n\nConcept alignment is *Indirect,general,specific*.\n\nGround observations are _NA_.\n\n The accuracy evaluation *Quantitative accuracy assessment,documented,quantitative*.\n\n## How to use the data\n\n### Available files\n\n\n\nYou can download geospatial data for this map from the following sources:\n\n**F3.5.WM.nwx** (v2.0): [Mapbox tileset](https://studio.mapbox.com/tilesets/jrfep.F3_5_WM_nwx){target=\"gisdata\"}\n\nNote that you need to login to some services like [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com){target=\"links\"} or [earthengine](https://earthengine.google.com){target=\"links\"}, and in some cases you also need to request access to the files.\n\n###  License information\n\nIndicative maps have been released with a ![](https://zenodo.org/static/icons/licenses/cc-by-icon.svg){height=20} Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. \n\nDatasets used to create this map have similar licenses, but please check the license information below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|dataset |license_info |\n|:-------|:------------|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## References\n\nReferences used in this version of the maps.\n\n- Deepak Nagaraj, Eleanor Proust, Alberto Todeschini, Maria Cristina Rulli, Paolo D'Odorico (2021) *A new dataset of global irrigation areas from 2001 to 2015* **Advances in Water Resources** 152: 103910 [DOI:j.advwatres.2021.103910](http:dx.doi.org/j.advwatres.2021.103910) \n - Karra, Kontgis, et al.
