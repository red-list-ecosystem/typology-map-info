Within those areas, locations of small lakes (<100km2), excluding artificial lakes (inclusion on types 1 and 3 only), were taken from the HydroLAKES database (Messager et al. 2016) and combined with global estimates of surface water phenology (classes 1, 2 and 7 from Pekel et al. 2016), occurrences were aggregated to 10 minutes spatial resolution..\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nYou can download and use this file from the following sources:\n\n- Mapbox tileset ([GeoTIFF version uploaded to Mapbox](https://studio.mapbox.com/tilesets/jrfep.F2_8_web_mix))\n - Zenodo repository (EFG map) ([Includes GeoTIFF, GeoJSON and PNG files](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090958))\n - Zenodo repository (bundle of maps) ([Includes GeoTIFF, GeoJSON and PNG versions in compressed file](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090419))\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nThis section provides information about the valid indicative distribution map for the ecosystem functional group [**F2.8 Artesian springs and oases**](/efg-info/F2_8.qmd).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n## Available maps\n\nThese maps are considered current and valid indicative distribution maps for this ecosystem functional group.\n\n- Indicative Map (**code: F2.8.IM.mix**, version v1.0) \n - Web navigation (**code: F2.8.web.mix**, version v1.0) \n\n## Map files\n\nYou can download geospatial data for this map from the following sources:\n\nF2.8.IM.mix (v1.0){target=\"gisdata\"}: [Google Cloud bucket](gs://iucn_get_l3_im/F2.8.IM.mix_v1.0.tif) :: [Zenodo repository (bundle of maps)](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3958934)\nF2.8.web.mix (v1.0){target=\"gisdata\"}: [GitHub repository](F2.8.web.mix_v1.0_topo.json) :: [Google Cloud bucket](gs://iucn_get_l3_im/F2.8.web.mix_v1.0.tif) :: [Zenodo repository (bundle of maps)](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090419) :: [Zenodo repository (EFG map)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5090958) :: [Mapbox tileset](https://studio.mapbox.com/tilesets/jrfep.F2_8_web_mix) :: [GitHub repository](layers/F2.8.web.mix_v1.0_topo.json) :: [Earth Engine assets](projects/earthengine-legacy/assets/users/jrferrerparis/IUCN-GET/L3_IndMaps/)\n\nNote that you need to login to some services like [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com){target=\"links\"} or [earthengine](https://earthengine.google.com){target=\"links\"}, and in some cases you also need to request access to the files.\n\n",
